        <h2>Background</h2>
        I am from India. I have taken admission in Applied Computer Science Spring 2019 recently. I am interested to
        carry
        forward my career path in the field of Internet of things.

        Back in India, I have done my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineering. When I was in
        college I used to love Electronics a lot. I always wanted to work in the field of Electronics, because of this I
        started to prepare for the Indian Engineering Services Exam. In the year 2013 i.e in the last semester of my
        bachelor's
        degree I have cracked the Prelims of Indian Engineering Services but unfortunately, I could not crack the mains.
        I gave
        a second try in the year 2014 but the same thing happened again I cracked the prelims but I fall short by 9
        marks to
        crack Indian Engineering Services Mains. It was really a disturbing and heartbreaking situation for me, for my
        family
        and friends. After graduation, I had already lost 2 years owing to this my parents made me join a Software
        company
        called Cavirin. I was an Electronics and Telecommunication graduate and I did not have even the basic knowledge
        about
        computers when I joined Cavirin Systems. When I joined Cavirin initially I used to hate the job which I used to
        do
        there but as time progressed I started understanding multiple things about computers, programming languages the
        corporate work culture etc. and I started loving the stream I was in. Before I reached the USA I worked around
        3.5
        years into various domains.

        <h2>Current</h2>
        As I have mentioned above I used to and I will keep loving Electronics. Maybe As I have not studied Electronics
        from
        last 5 years, I have lost the touch to it but I am pretty sure that after taking the course here in NWMSU I
        would be in
        a position to do best things by blending concepts of Electronics and Computers. I have decided to do career in
        the
        Internet of Things which is combination of Electronics and Telecommunication. I want to make my knowledge useful
        for
        solving the natural happening around us by unfolding the scientific reasons behind it. With the knowledge, I
        gather
        during my Masters. I will try to apply my skills to the practical working problems for the betterment of mankind
        by
        contributing in the stream of Internet of Things. I strongly believe that under the guidance of laureate
        professors
        here in Northwest I will put my best efforts to become a good IoT Engineer.

        <h2>Plans</h2>
        Apart from the academics, I have a special interest in the field of Indian classical music. I have completed
        till
        Madhyama Purn (kind of undergraduate) in Indian classical Vocal and till Madhyama Pratham in Tabla (An Indian
        Rytham
        Instrument). These Exams are conducted by Akhil Bhartiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya only Indian classical music
        university
        in the world which conducts written and Practical Exams on different areas of Indian Classical Music. If I get a
        chance
        with the knowledge I gathered and I will be gathering in the field of science I would love to work on
        modernizing the
        Indian classical music instruments. For example Mohan Veena, it is A modified Guitar and sarod, created by sarod
        player
        Radhika Mohan Maitra in the 1940s and legacy is carried forward by Vishwa Mohan Bhatt.
